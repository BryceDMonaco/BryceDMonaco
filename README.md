Hey! My name is Bryce and this is my personal GitHub account! I use this to keep track of all of my prototypes, small ideas, and other personal projects, all mostly in Unity.

I am interested in game design and development, Java development, and Python development.

I am always looking to learn new skills and am currently learning as much as I can about Unity shaders, Python Machine Learning, and full stack Java development.

Want to work on something together? Send me a message!
