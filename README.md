Howdy! My name is Bryce and this is my personal GitHub account! I use this to keep track of all of my prototypes, small ideas, and other personal projects, all mostly in Godot, Unity, Typescript, and Java.

I am interested in game design and development, Java development, and Typescript development.

I love trying out new tools and processes, and love learning new skills.

Want to work on something together? Send me a message!
